# README

Ruby on Rails app for hosting student portfolios! Developed in CS 3300 â€” Intro to Software Engineering

# Need To Know

Remember to migrate database on Heroku with pushes: `heroku rake db:migrate`

Creating integration tests for features: `bundle exec rails g rspec:feature projects`

# Known Issues

CircleCI will always report, "Coverage report generated for RSpec to /root/project/coverage. 0 / X LOC (0.0%) covered." I've tried 7 times with different methods. This is a bug to know (I suspect version conflicts or misconfiguration).
